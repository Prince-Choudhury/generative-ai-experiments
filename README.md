## 📌 About

This repo is a personal log of everything I'm learning about Generative AI — including concepts like LLMs (Large Language Models), prompt engineering, LangChain, vector databases, embeddings, and more.

I'm following tutorials, building small projects, and experimenting with tools like Gemini, OpenAI, and HuggingFace.
